\section{Requirements}
  Now we've identified our stakeholders we can start thinking about the requirements for both user and system. In this section I will first identify user
  requirements, which can be described as \textit{'user requirements are statements, in a natural language'} [13].
  Then dig into each outlining the functional and non-functional requirements of that user requirement.

  \subsection{The system should allow users details to be stored}
  These requirements fulfill feature - \textbf{Adding customer information}.
    \begin{table}[H]
      \centering
      \begin{tabular}{|p{0.6\textwidth}|p{0.15\textwidth}|p{0.25\textwidth}|}
        \hline
        Requirement & Type & Actors \\ \hline

  is modelled by a member of staff changing the status of the vehicle on the system.
    \begin{table}[H]
