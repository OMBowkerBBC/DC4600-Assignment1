\section{Design}
  In this section I have designed activity and sequence diagrams for some of the proposed changes. I have colour coded where possible to show
  errors/failures and bad routes, tending to be in red, successful routes in green, and the yellow which signifies a potential error, or
  inaccuracy within the system but not a total failure.

  \subsection{Adding a new user}
    As part of adding a new user I have also modelled the login/register, I did this because without being signed in a customer
    would not be able to rent.

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=12cm]{diagrams/activity/Activity1.png}
      \caption{Activity diagram for adding a new user, this includes sign in/up.}
      \label{fig:newUserActivity}
    \end{figure}

    The above diagram shows 3 happy paths and 2 sad paths. The sad paths are the user quitting the process, however it is worth
    noting that a user could quit the application during any stage of the process. The first happy path is when a sessions exists.
    This points to some kind of session/cookie management in the future. The second is credentials stored in the database of an 
    existing user.

      \caption{Sequence diagram for adding a new user, this includes sign in/up.}
      \label{fig:newUserSequence}
    \end{figure}

  \subsection{Taking a payment}

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=12cm]{diagrams/activity/Activity2.png}
      \caption{Activity diagram for taking a payment.}
      \label{fig:takePaymentActivity}
    \end{figure}

    Taking a payment refers to online payments. If the user fails multiple times (3) then the system should stop
    the user from trying again, at least for a short while. This is to stop spamming and potential malicious activity.
    This is also includes the path of paying with crypto and cards to help reach some of Aston's business goals.

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=12cm]{diagrams/sequence/Sequence2.png}
      \caption{Sequence diagram for taking a payment.}
      \label{fig:takePaymentSequence}
    \end{figure}

  \subsection{Adding a new car}

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=6cm]{diagrams/activity/Activity5.png}
      \caption{Activity diagram for adding a new car to the system.}
      \label{fig:newCarActivity}
    \end{figure}

    When adding a car a user has two optional stages, taxing the vehicle and MOT'ing the car. These are needed for the 
    car to be rentable, however don't necessarily have to be done when adding the vehicle. However the diagram shows that
    if these criteria are not met the car is marked as unrentable until they have been fulfilled.

      \includegraphics[width=12cm]{diagrams/sequence/Sequence5.png}
      \caption{Sequence diagram for adding a new car to the system.}
