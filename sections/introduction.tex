\section{Introduction}
ACME (Aston Car Management Enterprises) is a car rental that offers rentals, primarily but not exclusively, to people in the Aston area.
This includes a range of customers from working individuals to the large student population the city has. The company currently uses email and telephone
for both customer requests and internal communications. 

However the company has realised that the current system is outdated and not a good user experience for the customer. In addition to this the 
profits of the company have been on a slow decline as newer competition has risen, taking away some of ACMEs customer base. 

The aim of this report is to come up with ways in which this problem can be tackled, coming up with a design that can be implemented. This report
discuss the stakeholders, business goals and current situation ACME is in. From this use cases and requirements will for the new system will be designed,
followed by both activity and sequence diagrams to demonstrate how the system could work on a lower level. Finally the report will evaluate the suggested
design, offering additional changes that could be made in the future.
